# SuiFusion

Sui Fusion extends 1inch Fusion+ protocol to SUI. What sets SuiFusion apart from others is that it is fully working deployed with UI and enables partial fills, has test for every case of the step for 1inch Fusion+ Swaps like private and public withdraws,cancel etc.. The move contracts respect HLTL logic and also the dutch auction extension is implemented. SuiFusion Extends the current `@1inch/cross-chain-sdk` and adds Sui Primitives to it. It comes with a fully working resolver backend, a relayer which communicates through a websocket stream. It is also shipped with a basic qouter.
